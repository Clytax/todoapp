# Project Title

React TODO App

# Project Description

This app provides a simple Todo App that allows you to enter the current things you need to do.
After completing these tasks, you are able to mark them as completed or delete them completely.
The App also allows you to sort the items by showing only the completed ones, all or only the active ones. With the persistent middleware of [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) even after refreshing the app you still have the tasks because they are stored in your local storage. I hope you enjoy this App.
