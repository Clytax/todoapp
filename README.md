## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Zustand - Global State
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JSX

- SCSS | Mixins | Functions | Media queries | Variables |
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Bem Naming Convention
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Wow this definetly was a great journey! I didnt think I would be able to do this challenge with my current skillset but it feld amazing when I realised that I can! I learned how to use the global state library Zustand and also use Media queries inside of react! I tried to add the drag and drop method but I wasnt able to implement.

### Continued development

If I manage to implement drag-and-drop functionality, I'd love to, but for now I'm happy with how this turned out, and I'm about to embark on a new challenge ^^
